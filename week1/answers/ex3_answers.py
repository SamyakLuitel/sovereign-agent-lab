Exercise 3 — Answers
====================
Fill this in after completing the three Rasa conversations.

CALM vs Old Rasa — what changed
---------------------------------
The old open-source Rasa approach used:
  - nlu.yml: intent training examples
  - rules.yml: explicit dialogue rules
  - FormValidationAction: Python class to parse slot values

Rasa Pro CALM uses:
  - flows.yml: natural language descriptions of what each flow does
  - from_llm slots: the LLM extracts values from conversation
  - ONE custom action: ActionValidateBooking for the business rules

The conversation is the same from the manager's perspective.
The machinery underneath is completely different.

CONVERSATION SCRIPTS
---------------------
Conversation 1 (happy path):
  You:    calling to confirm a booking
  Agent:  [asks guest count]
  You:    160 guests
  Agent:  [asks vegan count]
  You:    about 50 need vegan
  Agent:  [asks deposit]
  You:    £200 deposit
  Agent:  [confirms or escalates?]

Conversation 2 (deposit too high):
  Same as above but use a deposit above £300 (e.g. "£500 deposit").

Conversation 3 (out of scope):
  Start normally, then when asked for vegan count say something like
  "can you arrange parking for the speakers?" and observe what happens.
  Does CALM handle this differently than the old rules approach?

CALM was able to recognize the requesst from the user is out of scope that it cannot 
arrange the parking for the speakers , it clearly stated its boundaries and directed the user to contact the 
event organizer and continued with the confirm booking flow.

OUT_OF_SCOPE_COMPARISON = """
While both Rasa CALM and LangGraph recognized that the user's request was out of scope and provided a response 
indicating it would be able to fullfill the request , the handling was diffrent . Rasa CALM used a structured flow 
and it was able to continue with the confirmattion process after addressing out of scope request while the 
Langchain agent relied on the ressoning to find out that it cannot fuldill the request even though explicit flow for the 
case was defined.

# ── CALM vs Old Rasa ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# In the old open-source Rasa (3.6.x), you needed:
#   ValidateBookingConfirmationForm with regex to parse "about 160" → 160.0
#   nlu.yml intent examples to classify "I'm calling to confirm"
#   rules.yml to define every dialogue path
#
# In Rasa Pro CALM, you need:
#   flow descriptions so the LLM knows when to trigger confirm_booking
#   from_llm slot mappings so the LLM extracts values from natural speech
#   ONE action class (ActionValidateBooking) for the business rules

Think about:
- What does the LLM handle now that Python handled before?
- What does Python STILL handle, and why (hint: business rules)?
- Is there anything you trusted more in the old approach?
"""

# ── The setup cost ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

# CALM still required: config.yml, domain.yml, flows.yml, endpoints.yml,
# rasa train, two terminals, and a Rasa Pro licence.
# The old Rasa ALSO needed nlu.yml, rules.yml, and a FormValidationAction.
#
# CALM is simpler. But it's still significantly more setup than LangGraph.
# That setup bought you something specific.

SETUP_COST_VALUE = """
FILL ME IN

Be specific. What can the Rasa CALM agent NOT do that LangGraph could?
Is that a feature or a limitation for the confirmation use case?
Think about: can the CALM agent improvise a response it wasn't trained on?
Can it call a tool that wasn't defined in flows.yml?
